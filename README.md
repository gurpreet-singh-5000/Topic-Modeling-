# Topic-Modeling-
This project aims to analyze the two datasets, 'State of the Union' and 'AP Wire Stories'. Topic modeling is a technique which converts the words present in the text into more usable form, groups them and then extracts the relevant information. The details of the project are present [here](https://github.com/gurpreet-singh-5000/Topic-Modeling/blob/master/Report.pdf).
